    "question": "What is the purpose of the Attendance Improvement Plan (AIP) system?",
    "expected_answer": "The Attendance Improvement Plan (AIP) is an online system that helps New Mexico schools create student attendance improvement plans and action plans to improve attendance. It allows schools to track attendance trends across schools, plan evidence\u2011based strategies to improve attendance, and monitor progress through reporting periods (80\u2011day, 120\u2011day, end\u2011of\u2011year).",
    "model_answer": "The Attendance Improvement Plan (AIP) system is designed to help New Mexico schools create student attendance plans, identify strategies to improve attendance, and monitor progress through reporting periods. It also enables the PED Absence Coordinator to oversee and support the implementation of AIPs to ensure compliance with state attendance guidelines, identify systemic issues, facilitate interventions, drive accountability, and promote best practices.",
